## General Intro Knowledge

> A DB is simply an organized set of data that typically persists

* Different DBs serve different purposes and are better for particular use cases
	* Relational Stores
		* SQlite
			* Operates off of a file like an Excel workbook
		* Postgres
		* MySql
		* Google Spanner
	* Key-Value Stores
		* Redis
		* Dynamo DB
	* Column Stores
		* Cassandra
		* Apache HBASE
	* Graph Databases
		* neo4j
		* graphQL
	* Document Databases
		* Mongo DB

## Relational Algebra & Codds Relational Model

* Edward Codd in 1969 developed "Codd's Relational Model"
	* It is a way of organizing data like an Excel worksheet
		* A relation (table) is a set of tuples (rows)
		* Each element (cell value) in a tuple is a member of a data domain (set of allowed values)
		* These elements are called attribute values and are associated with an attribute (column name + type)
	* The important idea that comes from this is "schemas"

### Schemas

> Schemas come from the Greek word for shape...like the shape of your data

* Does not involve the values themselves but the shape
* Tables, column names, types and constraints
* Connected to your "data domain"

### Relational Algebra vs Relational Calculus

* Codd's theorum states that for every relational calculus we can come up with, there exists a relational algebra way of getting there

* To find the moves that Jeff Goldblum is in the:
	* Relational algebra way (imperative)
		* Join Movie and Actor over actorId
		* Filter the results to include those that include Jeff Goldblum
		* Select the movieTitle and year columns
	* Relational Calculus way (declarative)
		* Get movieTitle and year for Movie so that there exists an Actor A who was in the movie and is Jeff Goldblum

### Structured Query Language (SQL)

* Direct extension from Codd's work
* Declarative
* Used in Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
* Can be procedural as well like functions and control flow statements


#### SQL Language Elements

1. SELECT clause `SELECT * FROM Employee`
2. WHERE clause `WHERE id = 123 AND is_admin = 'true'`
	* All the code after `WHERE` is called the Predicate
	* the `'true'` piece is known as the Expression
	* Both of these come together to form the Statement
		* A Statement is a complete sentence
		* Clauses are phrases of the sentence


#### Command Line SQL

* You can run sql queries from the command line
* You can create dbs from cli
* you can delete dbs from cli

##### Simple SELECT Queries

* Returns a result set
* FROM allows one or more elements to be returned from a relation

```
SELECT * FROM Employee
```
<img src="./simple-select.png" />
* SELECT grabs all records from Employee table

* Choosing elements
	* elements are returned in the order that you ask for them
	* It's good to be explicit so that:
		* You minimize the amount of data that you are sending over the wire
		* developer intent is clear
		* less I/O
		* Future schema changes will not affect results

```
SELECT id, firstname, lastname FROM Employee
```

##### Quotes in SQL

* Usually table names, column names and keywords are case insensitive
* 'Single quotes' are used for string literals
* "Double quotes" or `backticks` (MySQL only) for words that conflict with SQL keywords, or when case sensitivity is desired 
* Quotes can have a drastic impact on what you receive

##### Aliases

* The `AS` keyword can be used to give a table or column an alias
* Only impacts the current query

##### WHERE

* used to filter a result set with a condition
* Make sure to use single quotes! unless you have a special use case or special characters

##### Conditions

* >, <, >=, <=, =
* Not equal: <> or !=
* Within a range: `temperature BETWEEN 68 AND 75`
* Member of a set: `companyname IN ('Microsoft', 'LinkedIn')`
* String ends with: `email LIKE '%.gov'`
* String includes: `summary LIKE '%siracha%'`
* String length: `email LIKE '__'`

##### AND, OR, NOT

* Boolean logic operators
* Parens for clarity

<img src="./boolean.png" />


##### Core Functions

* Each db has a slightly different set of core functions
* Some are the same like:
	* lower
	* max
	* min
	* count
	* substr
* You can use them in comparisons
	* `SELECT lower(title) AS name FROM Product`

##### Debugging Conditions

* Conditions can be evaluated directly with a SELECT statement
```
SELECT 'mike@example.com' LIKE '%@example.com'; -- TRUE
SELECT 'mike@gmail.com' LIKE '%@example.com'; -- FALSE
```

##### Sorting

* `ORDER BY` clause declares the desired sorting of the result set
* Sort Direction as `ASC` to `DESC`

##### Limiting

* Useful when dealing with large sets
* Can have good performance benefits when it comes to sending less data over the wire
* Doesn't help necessarily with making your DB do less work
* Performance gain could be huge if the DB doesn't have to sort the entire set
* Limiting should be your last clause (order matters!)

##### Offsetting

* Offset means to start with Nth result
* Combining this with LIMIT gives us the ability to paginate

##### Relationships

* Not where the term "relational" comes from
* It actually comes from the the concept of relational algebra
* EX: 1 customer can have MANY orders

##### JOIN

* Assemble tables together
* Joining can only be performed on a related column between two tables
* Whatever comes after the `FROM` is the left table and whatever comes after `JOIN` is the right table
```
SELECT *
FROM CustomerOrder AS o
LEFT JOIN Customer AS c
	ON c.id = o.customerid
```
* Four types of join:
	1. INNER JOIN
		* Will bring two tables together and will only give you things that exist in both tables
		* Will exclude non matches from left and right tables
		* Like if a customer exists in the customers table but doesn't have an order yet you wanna handle that case
	2. LEFT JOIN
		* Will ensure everything from the left table will be included but exclude non matches from the right table
		* Say you have Orders table on left and you want to add customername which is in the Customers table
			* LEFT JOIN would probably be the best fit because you want to include an order even if there is not a customer name match
	3. RIGHT JOIN
		* The opposite of LEFT JOIN
		* Some DBs don't support this like SQlite
	4. FULL JOIN
		* Will include non matches in both tables

* LEFT, RIGHT & FULL JOIN are known as OUTER JOINs
	* So OUTER JOINs allow for one or more rows to be partially empty because it doesn't have a corresponding match in anther table

##### JOIN Selecting Columns

* SELECT * is typically a bad idea because it can lead to duplicate columns like `id` which exists as a column usually in every table
* So it is better to SELECT only the columns you want using aliasing

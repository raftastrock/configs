# Intro to Unix/Linux

## History
> Linux, Mac, and Android are based on ideas and specs of *UNIX*

* Started as an os at AT&T in the 60s
* Unix was originally built for large *mainframe computers* that people would use at the same time
* Every program on UNIX system read input from *standard input devide (stdin)* and write to *standard output (stdout)*
  * The big idea is that rather than type everything yourself, you can have the computer **type for you**
  * There were terminals and you ran your commands which "printed out" your stuff to an actual printer
  

## Shell
> UNIX still matters because it is still portable to many kinds of hardware

* **Introduction to Bash, VIM & Regex**
  * wifi routers
  * dsl and cable modems
  * raspberry pi, beaglebone, nvidia, jetson
  * android phones
  * linux laptop or desktop
  * Mac OSX computer
  * Web server

### Philosophy
> A set of principles of how programs should relate to each other

* each program should do one thing well
* the output of a program can be the **input** of another
